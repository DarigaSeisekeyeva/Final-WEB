            <h2 class="section-heading">Culture of Kazakhstan</h2>
            <p>Kazakhstan culture reflects the history of the nomadic tribes which roamed the Kazakh steppe forming their unique worldview, creating eclectic customs and traditions, and mixing with neighboring cultures. Many Kazakhs adopted a more sedentary lifestyle in the 19th and 20th centuries, leading to the development of new cultural characteristics for Kazakhs, such as huge, glittering, modern cities. Today, Kazakhstan culture represents the peoples of large swaths of Central Asia, capturing this nomadic spirit in various types of arts and traditions.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Food in Kazakhstan</h2>
            <p>Nomadic life laid the foundation for Kazakh national cuisine many centuries ago. Much energy was required for the people’s rugged lifestyle lived out under harsh climactic conditions, and as a result the local diet has long featured hearty dishes made from filling and readily available ingredients, namely <em>meat</em> and <em>milk</em> products. Traditional Kazakhstan food today is a symbiosis of traditions old and new.</p>
            <ul class="food-list">
                <li>Besbarmak: is the national dish of Kazakhstan, and as such is served at nearly every feast. This dish of boiled meat and thin squares of homemade noodles is usually served with broth on a large communal plate.</li>
                <li>Kazy and shuzhyk: two types of homemade horse sausage that are often seen on the table on holidays.</li>
                <li>Kumys: is a popular Kazakh drink made with fermented mare’s milk. It’s been an important source of refreshment and nourishment for Turkic and Mongol nomads for thousands of years.</li>
                <li>Baursak: made from a simple dough of flour, yeast, salt, and sugar, these golden nuggets are deep-fried until they turn crisp on the outside while remaining soft and fluffy on the inside.</li>
